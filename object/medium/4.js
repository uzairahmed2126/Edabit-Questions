// Make a Circle with OOP
// Your task is to create a Circle constructor that creates a circle with a radius provided by an argument. The circles constructed must have two methods getArea() (PI*r^2) and getPerimeter() (2*PI*r) which give both respective areas and perimeter (circumference).

// For help with this class, I have provided you with a Rectangle constructor which you can use as a base example.

// Examples
class Circle {
  constructor(radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }
  getArea() {
    return Math.PI * Math.pow(this.radius, 2);
  }
  getPerimeter() {
    return 2 * Math.PI * this.radius;
  }
}
let circy1 = new Circle(11);
console.log(circy1.getArea());

// Should return 380.132711084365
let circy2 = new Circle(4.44);
console.log(circy2.getPerimeter());

// Should return 27.897342763877365
// Notes
// Don't worry about floating point precision - I've factored in the chance that your answer may be more or less accurate than mine. This is more of a tutorial than a challenge so the topic covered may be considered advanced, yet the challenge is more simple - so if this challenge gets labelled as easy, don't worry too much.
