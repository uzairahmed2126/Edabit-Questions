// ES6: Destructuring Objects I
// In JavaScript, you can do basic object assignment like this:

const obj = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 };

let one = obj.one;
let two = obj.two;
let three = obj.three;
console.log(one, two, three);
// However, with ES6 you can assign the variables in a much more succinct way. Use ES6 object destructuring to assign variables one and two to obj.one and obj.two respectively.

// Although you can use let, var, or const for assignment, DO NOT use these in this challenge.

// Notes
// Ignore the backticks `` (used for validation).
// Ignore the .toString() function (used for validation).
// Replace the commented part of the first line with proper, left-side part of the solution.
// If you know how to use object destructuring, go ahead and complete the challenge, otherwise check the Resources tab for examples and then come back to try the challenge.
