// Intersecting Intervals
// Create a function that takes in an array of intervals and returns how many intervals overlap with a given point.

// An interval overlaps a particular point if the point exists inside the interval, or on the interval's boundary. For example the point 3 overlaps with the interval [2, 4] (it is inside) and [2, 3] (it is on the boundary).

// To illustrate:
function countOverlapping(interval, point) {
  let count = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < interval.length; i++) {
    let [first, last] = interval[i];
    if (point >= first && point <= last) {
      count++;
    }
  }
  return count;
}
console.log(
  countOverlapping(
    [
      [1, 2],
      [2, 3],
      [1, 3],
      [4, 5],
      [0, 1],
    ],
    2
  )
); //➞ 3
// Since [1, 2], [2, 3] and [1, 3] all overlap with point 2.
// Examples
console.log(
  countOverlapping(
    [
      [1, 2],
      [2, 3],
      [3, 4],
    ],
    5
  )
); //➞ 0
console.log(
  countOverlapping(
    [
      [1, 2],
      [5, 6],
      [5, 7],
    ],
    5
  )
); //➞ 2
console.log(
  countOverlapping(
    [
      [1, 2],
      [5, 8],
      [6, 9],
    ],
    7
  )
); //➞ 2
// Notes
// Each interval is represented as an array with a start point and an endpoint.
// Intervals count as intersecting even if they only intersect at one point, i.e. [2, 3] and [3, 4] both intersect at point 3.
// If it's helpful, you can draw these intervals on a line on a piece of paper.
