// Fix the Spacing
// Additional spaces have been added to a sentence. Return the correct sentence by removing them. All words should be separated by one space, and there should be no spaces at the beginning or end of the sentence.

// Examples
console.log(correctSpacing("The film   starts       at      midnight. "))
//➞ "The film starts at midnight."

console.log(correctSpacing("The     waves were crashing  on the     shore.   "))
//➞ "The waves were crashing on the shore."

console.log(correctSpacing(" Always look on    the bright   side of  life."))
//➞ "Always look on the bright side of life."
// Notes
