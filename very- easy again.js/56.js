// First Class, Second Class and Third Class Levers
// Levers are simple machines with a rigid beam and a fulcrum. From the picture below, you can see that there are 3-types of levers: first class, second class and third class.

// In a first class lever, the fulcrum is situated in the middle with the effort and the load being positioned opposite of each other.
// In a second class lever, the fulcrum is situated in the right with the effort on the left and the load in the middle.
// In a third class lever, the fulcrum is situated in the left with the effort being in the middle and the load being on the right.

// Given an array that contains the fulcrum "f", the effort "e", and the load "l", write a function that determines whether or not the array shows a first class lever, second class lever, or a third class lever.

// Examples
function determineLever(arr) {
  if (arr[1] === "f") {
    return "first class lever";
  } else if (arr[2] === "f") {
    return "second class lever";
  }
  return "third class lever";
}
console.log(determineLever(["e", "f", "l"])); //➞ "first class lever"
console.log(determineLever(["e", "l", "f"])); //➞ "second class lever"
console.log(determineLever(["f", "e", "l"])); //➞ "third class lever"
// Notes
// A pair of scissors is a first class lever, a nutcracker is a second class lever and a broom is a third class lever.
