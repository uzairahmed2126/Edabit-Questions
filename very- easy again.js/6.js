// Buggy Code (Part 1)
// Fix the code in the code tab to pass this challenge (only syntax errors). Look at the examples below to get an idea of what the function should do.

// Examples
function cubes(num) {
  //   return num ** 3;
  return Math.pow(num, 3);
}
console.log(cubes(3)); //➞ 27
console.log(cubes(5)); //➞ 125
console.log(cubes(10)); //➞ 1000
// Notes
// READ EVERY WORD CAREFULLY, CHARACTER BY CHARACTER!
// Don't overthink this challenge; it's not supposed to be hard.
