// Correct the Mistakes
// Fix the code in the code tab to pass this challenge (only syntax errors). Look at the examples below to get an idea of what the function should do.

// Examples
function squared(num) {
    return num * num;
  //   return Math.pow(num, 2);
  //   return num ** 2;
}
console.log(squared(5)); //➞ 25

console.log(squared(9)); //➞ 81

console.log(squared(100)); //➞ 10000
// Notes
// READ EVERY WORD CAREFULLY, CHARACTER BY CHARACTER!
// Don't overthink this challenge; it's not supposed to be hard.
