// Snail Race
// Steve and Maurice have racing snails. They each have three, a slow s, medium m and fast f one. Although Steve's snails are all a bit stronger than Maurice's, Maurice has a trick up his sleeve. His plan is

// Round 1: [s, f] Sacrifice his slowest snail against Steve's fastest.
// Round 2: [m, s] Use his middle snail against Steve's slowest.
// Round 3: [f, m] Use his fastest snail against Steve's middle.
// Create a function that determines whether Maurice's plan will work by outputting true if Maurice wins 2/3 games.

// The function inputs:

// Array 1: [s, m, f] for Maurice.
// Array 2: [s, m, f] for Steve.
// Examples
function mauriceWins(mourice, steve) {
  let round1 = mourice[0] > steve[2];
  let round2 = mourice[1] > steve[0];
  let round3 = mourice[2] > steve[1];
  let mouricewinscount = round1 + round2 + round3 >= 2;
  return mouricewinscount;
}
console.log(mauriceWins([3, 5, 10], [4, 7, 11])); //➞ true
// Since the matches are (3, 11), (5, 4) and (10, 7), Maurice wins 2 out of 3.

console.log(mauriceWins([6, 8, 9], [7, 12, 14])); //➞ false
// Since the matches are (6, 14), (8, 7) and (9, 12), Steve wins 2 out of 3.

console.log(mauriceWins([1, 8, 20], [2, 9, 100])); //➞ true
// Notes
// Maurice wins if his competing snail's speed strictly exceeds Steve's snail's speed.
// Steve will always play in this order: [f, s, m].
// The order you'll get the snails is always in ascending order.
