// Burglary Series (10): Calculate Difference
// The insurance guy calls again and apologizes. They found another policy made by your spouse, but this one is limited to cover a particular maximum in losses (for example, 50,000€). You send a bill to your spouse for the difference you lost.

// Given an object of the stolen items and a limit, return the difference between the total value of those items and the limit of the policy.

// Examples
function calculateDifference(object, val) {
  let arr = Object.values(object);
  let total = arr.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + cur);//arrow function calles lembda
  return total - val;
  //   let result = 0;
  //   for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  //     result += arr[i];
  //   }
  //   return result - val;
}
console.log(calculateDifference({ "baseball bat": 20 }, 5)); //➞ 15
console.log(calculateDifference({ skate: 10, painting: 20 }, 19)); //➞ 11
console.log(calculateDifference({ skate: 200, painting: 200, shoes: 1 }, 400)); //➞ 1
// Notes
// The object will always contain items (no empty objects).
// The sum of the items will always be greater than the limit.
